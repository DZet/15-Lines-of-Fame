# Pythonistas-NL 15 Lines of Fame
This repo serves as the central repo for the '15 lines of fame' timeslot in the Pythonistas-NL meetup. Participants can contribute code to this repository
that will then be showcased by the contributor in the next meetup. 

This repo provides all instructions to get up and running. 

## 15 Lines of Fame
The '15 lines of fame' session is a reserved timeslot in the Pythonistas-NL meetup aimed at providing support for participants. 
Participants can use this timeslot to share code and receive the groups undivided attention. Practical use-cases are:
    - Asking for help ('Why does this not work?') 
    - Showcasing something new that you've learned;
    - Asking how to improve code
    - etc.

We have a central huge screen that we can use to showcase code, but it's more conventient if participants contribute their code to a central repo. 
This saves us from having to swap laptops for each snippet of code.
